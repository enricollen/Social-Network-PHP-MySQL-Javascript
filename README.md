# Social-Network-PHP-MySQL-Javascript
An open source Social Network called "Pausa Caffè" (=Coffee break) written in php, MySQL DB, JS. Originally developed for the exam 'Web Development' during my Bachelor Degree, i tried to show the basic architecture of a PHP based web application. The whole code/comments are in Italian btw. <br>
>> For DB connection you need to change the config file located in /include/configDB.ini
